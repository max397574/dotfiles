## Colorscheme
The theme used in the screenshots is doom-one.
I change this from time to time though.
I can do this automatically with a script which changes colors for starship, terminal, neovim and übersicht widgets.

## Details
- OS: MacOS 11.4
- WM: Yabai
- Terminal: Kitty

## Neovim
Check the [readme of the repo](https://github.com/max397574/NeovimConfig).

## Starship Prompt
